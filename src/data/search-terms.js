// My initial idea is that if a user wants, they can optionally use one
// of our pre-defined 'curated' search terms. These are vetted by doing
// a live test of autocomplete against the term:

module.exports = [{
  term: "why isn't ",
}, {
  term: "i am extremely terrified of ",
}, {
  term: "is it better to have ",
}, {
  term: "how do i tell my ",
}, {
  term: "how can i be sure that ",
}, {
  term: "on what day did ",
}, {
  term: "why is there a ",
}, {
  term: "why do i always ",
}, {
  term: "why don't i ever ",
}, {
  term: "why don't we ever ",
}, {
  term: "what is it called when ",
}, {
  term: "why do people ",
}, {
  term: "why don't people ",
}, {
  term: "don't you hate it when a ",
}, {
  term: "never put a ",
}, {
  term: "what happens if i take ",
}, {
  term: "what happens if i don't ",
}, {
  term: "why don't people ",
}];
